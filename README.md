# Who Do You BeLeaf You Are?

I've lived around Toronto my whole life and often wondered how to classify Leafs fans. This application uses JQuery to do just that. Users take a quiz that follows responsive design and accessibility principles to find out what kind of fan they are. 

This was a really fun project to build. It was my first foray into JQuery and so it might be a typically simple first project. However, as a passionate Leafs fan I enjoyed pouring my hot/cold relationship with the team into it. I learned so much over the course of this project - and maybe even a bit about myself as a fan.
